# SciPy Sparse Matrix benchmarks

These are some benchmarks comparing the run time of common operations on different format of sparse matrixes in SciPy.
The repository should be checked out and run on your hardware.

These are intended to provide some numbers for some back of the envelope calculation to aid design decisions.
